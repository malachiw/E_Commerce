This is a sample e-commerce site.

I am using MariaDB, PHP and HTML create the functionality of the web apps.

The web page will
 1. The Login form should consist of fields for username, email address and 
	password. 
 2. After login, a welcome message should appear providing a simple order form
	with at least 10 products of your choice. Be sure to include an image
	of the product and price. 
 3. Users can shop your store for up to 30 minutes before the session will 
	expire. 
 4. Once all prodcuts are selected, the user should be able to checkout and pay
	for their purchases. 
 5. The payment page should display the username, email address and the product
	and total price of purchases.   
 6. A "Purchase" button should be available to indicate the product was 
	purchased and should generate a "Thank you" message of your choice. 
 7. On the Thank you message page, an option for logging out and essentially
	unsetting the stored sessions variables should be available and 
	implemented.
 8. Note all pages should have a session timeout functionality.
